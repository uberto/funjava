Issues:


implicit controller
implicit ui template
user service/repository overlap
mutable User
db session implicit
annotations driven DI
optional.isPresent



put all the correct stuff on pom as commented

switch to webflux
Show the 4 steps
show how to create a function and combine, and then
introduce View static class (or just put html functions)
replace jpa with jooq? or otherwise just fake fun
user as record
remove UserService
explain result/checked exceptions

start it from main and remove annotations?
